# About me
I'm a science enthusiast majoring in computer science, but I am also interested in psychology, social sciences, and, last but not least, philosophy.

My main interests in computer science are Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning methods applied in Autonomous Vehicles and Self-Driving Cars. Besides, I'm also interested in private ML, trustworthy AI, and NLP in general.

And if you want to know what I typically do, peek 3 of the following:

- Studying/Reading/Working, mostly CS-related subjects
- Long-distance Running
- Watching streams, mostly in nature!
- Watching movies
- Sky Watching!

With more than 90% confidence, I'm doing one of them at the moment!
