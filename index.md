# About me
I'm a lifelong learner and a science enthusiast majoring in computer science, but I am also interested in psychology, complex systems, and, last but not least, philosophy. My primary interest lies in the intersection of Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning methods applied in Autonomous Vehicles and Robotics. Besides, I'm also interested in private ML, trustworthy AI, and NLP in general.

And if you want to know what I typically do, peek 3 of the following:

- Studying / Reading / Working, mostly CS-related subjects
- Long-distance Running (find me in [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/69027970))
- Watching streams, mostly in nature!
- Watching movies
- Sky Watching!

With more than 90% confidence, I'm doing one of them at the moment!
